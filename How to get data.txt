A JSON file will be created from the xml file.

For now navigate to https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/DataSets/03_ALJ_Disposition_Data.xml
copy everything except the  "This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below."
Paste it into the judge-data.xml file

make sure you are in the ssa-judges directory 
type "npm run convert" into your favorite terminal. I use cmder. 

A JSON file will be made.

This should be done once a month to keep up with the latest data. 
New data seems to be released on the 29th.
